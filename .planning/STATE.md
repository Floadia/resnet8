# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-27)

**Core value:** Accurate Keras→ONNX conversion — ONNX model must produce equivalent results to the original Keras model (>85% accuracy on CIFAR-10)
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Model Conversion

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 2 (Model Conversion)
Plan: None yet (ready to plan)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-01-27 — Roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: None yet
- Trend: N/A

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- ONNX instead of PyTorch: User plans future ONNX evaluation work
- tf2onnx for conversion: Standard tool for Keras→ONNX, well-maintained
- Separate converter/eval scripts: Reusability and clarity

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
